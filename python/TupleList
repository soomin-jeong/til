List vs Tuple

list: [a, b, c]
tuple: (a, b, c)

1) Common:
  1. stores a sequence of items
  2. can store any type of data (str, int, ...)
  3. can access items by index

2) Different
  1. list is *mutable* and tuple is *immutable*
  2. therefore list allows append yet the tuple does not.

3) + Essence of immutability
  It guarantees better memory efficiency.
